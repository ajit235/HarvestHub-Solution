As countries transition from fossil fuels to renewable sources, woody biomass stands out as a viable alternative due to its abundance and relatively low environmental impact.</p>        <h2>North America: Leading the Charge</h2>        <p>In North America, the market growth is propelled by government incentives and the vast availability of forestry resources. The U.S. alone has seen a significant rise in woody biomass power plants, which reached approximately <strong>9.3 GW</strong> of installed capacity in 2022. Key states like California and Washington are leveraging biomass energy to complement their renewable portfolios.</p>        <h2>Europe: Striking a Balance</h2>        <p>Europe exhibits a mixed landscape, with strong emphasis on sustainability. The EU's <strong>Green Deal</strong> promotes biomass as a renewable source, yet countries like Germany and Sweden face challenges with sustainability certification. The region generated around <strong>43.8 TWh</strong> of electricity from biomass in recent years, and initiatives are underway to optimize wood waste utilization.</p>        <h2>Asia-Pacific: Emerging Markets</h2>        <p>The Asia-Pacific region, particularly nations like China and India, is increasingly recognizing the potential of woody biomass for energy generation. Japan's <strong>feed-in tariff</strong> program for biomass power helped catalyze the growth of the sector, with nearly <strong>2.5 GW</strong> of biomass capacity installed as of late 2022.</p>        <h2>Latin America and Africa: Untapped Potential</h2>        <p>In Latin America, countries like Brazil are exploring agroforestry as a source for woody biomass. Despite facing regulatory hurdles, the potential for growth remains significant, especially with local government support. Meanwhile, Africaâ€™s reliance on traditional biomass for daily energy needs presents both challenges and opportunities for modern biomass solutions.</p>        <h2>Conclusion</h2>    </article></body></> This code represents an article structured following your specifications.
